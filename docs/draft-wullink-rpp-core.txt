1.  Introduction

   This document describes an Application Programming Interface (API)
   API based on the HTTP protocol [RFC2616] and the principles of
   [REST].  Conforming to the REST constraints is generally referred to
   as being "RESTful".  Hence the API is dubbed: "'RESTful Provisioning
   Protocol" or "RPP" for short.

   RPP is data format agnostic, this document describes a framework
   describing protocol messages in any data format. the client uses
   server-driven content negotiation.  Allowing the client to select
   from a set of representation media types supported by the server,
   such as JSON [RFC8259], XML or [YAML].

   REST - Representational State Transfer ([REST]).  An architectural
   style.

   RESTful - A RESTful web service is a web service or API implemented
   using HTTP and the principles of [REST].

   EPP RFCs - This is a reference to the EPP version 1.0 specifications
   [RFC5730], [RFC5731], [RFC5732] and [RFC5733].

   RESTful Provisioning Protocol or RPP - The protocol described in this
   document.

3.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
   NOT","SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   In examples, lines starting with "C:" represent data sent by a RPP
   client and lines starting with "S:" represent data returned by a RPP
   server.  Indentation and white space in examples are provided only to
   illustrate element relationships and are not REQUIRED features of the
   protocol.

   All example requests assume a RPP server using HTTP version 2 is
   listening on the standard HTTPS port on host rppp.example.nl.  An
   authorization token has been provided by an out of band process and
   MUST be used by the client to authenticate each request.

4.  Request Headers

   A RPP request does not always require a request message body.  The
   information conveyed by the HTTP method, URL, and request headers may
   be sufficient for the server to be able to successfully processes a
   request.  However, the client MUST include a request message body
   when the server requires additional attributes to be present in the
   request message.  The RPP HTTP headers listed below use the "RPP-"
   prefix, following the recommendations in [RFC6648].

   -  RPP-Cltrid: The client transaction identifier is the equivalent of
      the clTRID element defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used
      accordingly, when the HTTP message body does not contain an EPP
      request that includes a cltrid.

   -  RPP-AuthInfo: The client MAY use this header for sending basic
      token-based authorization information, as described in Section 2.6
      of [RFC5731] and Section 2.8 of [RFC5733].  If the authorization
      is linked to a contact object then the client MUST also include
      the RPP-Roid header.

   -  RPP-Roid: If the authorization info, is linked to a database
      object, the client MAY use this header for the Repository Object
      IDentifier (ROID), as described in Section 4.2 of [RFC5730].

5.  Response Headers

   The server HTTP response contains a status code, headers, and MAY
   contain an RPP response message in the message body.  HTTP headers
   are used to transmit additional data to the client and MAY be used to
   send RPP process related data to the client.  HTTP headers used by
   RPP MUST use the "RPP-" prefix, the following response headers have
   been defined for RPP.

   -  RPP-Svtrid: This header is the equivalent of the "svTRID" element
      defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used accordingly when the RPP
      response does not contain an EPP response in the HTTP message
      body.  If an HTTP message body with the EPP XML equivalent
      "svTRID" exists, both values MUST be consistent.

   -  RPP-Cltrid: This header is the equivalent of the "clTRID" element
      defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used accordingly when the RPP
      response does not contain an EPP response in the HTTP message
      body.  If the contents of the HTTP message body contains a
      "clTRID" value, then both values MUST be consistent.

Internet-Draft        RESTful Provisioning Protocol            July 2025


   -  RPP-Code: This header is the equivalent of the EPP result code
      defined in [RFC5730] and MUST be used accordingly.  This header
      MUST be added to all responses, except for the Greeting, and MAY
      be used by the client for easy access to the EPP result code,
      without having to parse the HTTP response message body.

   -  RPP-EPP-Code: An optional that MAY be used when RPP is used as a
      frontend service for an EPP service.  The header can be used by
      the client for easy access to the EPP result code, without having
      to parse the HTTP response message body.

   -  RPP-Check-Avail: An alternative for the "avail" attribute of the
      object:name element in an Object Check response and MUST be used
      accordingly.  The server does not return a HTTP message body in
      response to a RPP Object Check (HEAD) request.

   -  RPP-Queue-Size: Return the number of unacknowledged messages in
      the client message queue.  The server MAY include this header in
      all RPP responses.

6.  Endpoints

   subsequent sections provide details for each endpoint.  URLs are
   assumed to be using the prefix: "/{context-root}/{version}/".  Some
   RPP endpoints do not require a request and/or response message.

   {c}: An abbreviation for {collection}: this MUST be substituted with
   "domains", "hosts", "entities" or any other collection of objects.
   {i}: An abbreviation for an object id, this MUST be substituted with
   the value of a domain name, hostname, contact-id or a message-id or
   any other defined object.

   A RPP client MAY use the HTTP GET method for executing informational
   request only when no request data has to be added to the HTTP message
   body.  Sending content using an HTTP GET request is discouraged in
   [RFC9110], there exists no generally defined semantics for content
   received in a GET request.  When an RPP object requires additional
   information, the client MUST use the HTTP POST method and add the
   query command content to the HTTP message body.

6.1.  Check for Existence

   -  Request: HEAD /{collection}/{id}
   -  Request message: None
   -  Response message: None

Internet-Draft        RESTful Provisioning Protocol            July 2025


   The HTTP HEAD method MUST be used for object existence check.  The
   response MUST contain the RPP-Check-Avail header.  The value of the
   RPP-Check-Avail header MUST be false or true, depending on whether
   the object can be provisioned.

   The Check endpoint MUST be limited to checking only a single object-
   id per request, to allow the server to effiently load balance
   requests.

   Example request for a domain name:

   HEAD /rpp/v1/domains/example.nl HTTP/2
   Host: rpp.example.nl
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Accept-Language: en
   RPP-Cltrid: ABC-12345

   Example response:

   HTTP/2 200 OK
   Date: Wed, 24 Jan 2024 12:00:00 UTC
   Server: Example RPP server v1.0
   RPP-Cltrid: ABC-12345
   RPP-Svtrid: XYZ-12345
   RPP-Check-Avail: false
   RPP-result-code: 1000
   Content-Length: 0

6.2.  Resource Information

   The Object Info request MUST use the HTTP GET method on a resource
   identifying an object instance.  If the object has authorization
   information attached then the client MUST use an empty message body
   and include the RPP-AuthInfo HTTP header.  If the authorization is
   linked to a database object the client MUST also include the RPP-Roid
   header.  The client MAY also use a message body that includes the
   authorization information, the client MUST then not use the RPP-
   AuthInfo and RPP-Roid headers.

   -  Request: GET /{collection}/{id}
   -  Request message: Optional
   -  Response message: Info response

   Example request for an object not using authorization information.

6.3.  Poll for Messages

   The messages endpoint is used for retrieving messages stored on the
   server for the client to process.

   -  Request: GET /messages
   -  Request message: None
   -  Response message: Poll response

   The client MUST use the HTTP GET method on the messages resource
   collection to request the message at the head of the queue.

   Example request:

6.4.  Delete Message

   -  Request: DELETE /messages/{id}
   -  Request message: None
   -  Response message: Poll Ack response

   The client MUST use the HTTP DELETE method to acknowledge receipt of
   a message from the queue.  The "msgID" attribute of a received RPP
   Poll message MUST be included in the message resource URL, using the
   {id} path element.  The server MUST use RPP headers to return the RPP
   result code and the number of messages left in the queue.  The server
   MUST NOT add content to the HTTP message body of a successful
   response, the server may add content to the message body of an error
   response.

   Example request:

   DELETE /rpp/v1/messages/12345 HTTP/2
   Host: rpp.example.nl
   Authorization: Bearer <token>

6.5.  Create Resource

   -  Request: POST /{collection}
   -  Request message: Object Create request
   -  Response message: Object Create response

   The client MUST use the HTTP POST method to create a new object
   resource.  If the RPP request results in a newly created object, then
   the server MUST return HTTP status code 200 (OK).  The server MUST
   add the "Location" header to the response, the value of this header
   MUST be the URL for the newly created resource.

   Example Domain Create request:

6.8.  Transfer Resource

   The Transfer command is mapped to a nested resource, named
   "transfer".  The semantics of the HTTP DELETE method are determined
   by the role of the client executing the DELETE method.  The DELETE
   method is defined as "reject transfer" for the current sponsoring
   client of the object.  For the new sponsoring client the DELETE
   method is defined as "cancel transfer".

6.8.1.  Start

   -  Request: POST /{collection}/{id}/transfer
   -  Request message: Optional
   -  Response message: Status

Internet-Draft        RESTful Provisioning Protocol            July 2025


   In order to initiate a new object transfer process, the client MUST
   use the HTTP POST method on a unique resource to create a new
   transfer resource object.  Not all RPP objects support the Transfer
   command.

   If the transfer request is successful, then the response MUST include
   the Location header for the object being transferred.

   Example request not using object authorization:

   POST /rpp/v1/domains/example.nl/transfer HTTP/2
   Host: rpp.example.nl
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   Accept: application/rpp+json
   Accept-Language: en

6.8.2.  Status

   A transfer object may not exist, when no transfer has been initiated
   for the specified object.  The client MUST use the HTTP GET method
   and MUST NOT add content to the HTTP message body.

   -  Request: GET {collection}/{id}/transfer
   -  Request message: Optional

10.  Security Considerations

   RPP relies on the security of the underlying HTTP [RFC9110]
   transport, hence the best common practices for securing HTTP also
   apply to RPP.  It is RECOMMENDED to follow them closely.

   Data confidentiality and integrity MUST be enforced, all data
   transport between a client and server MUST be encrypted using TLS
   [RFC5246].  Section 9 describes the level of security that is
   REQUIRED for all RPP endpoints.

   Due to the stateless nature of RPP, the client MUST include the
   authentication credentials in each HTTP request.  This MAY be done by
   using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) [RFC7519] or Basic authentication
   [RFC7617].

11.  Change History

11.1.  Version 00 to 01

   -  Updated "Request Headers" and "Response Headers" section
   -  Changed transfer resource URL and HTTP method for reject, approve
      and cancel, in order to make the API easier to use

11.2.  Version 00 (draft-rpp-core) to 00 (draft-wullink-rpp-core)

      Convention, Session Management, HTTP Layer, Content Negotiation,
      Object Filtering, Error Handling
   -  Renamed Commands section to Endpoints
   -  Removed text about extensions
   -  Changed naming to be less EPP like and more RDAP like
